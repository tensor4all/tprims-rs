//! Scatter and block-scatter vectors.
//!
//! A tensor participating in a contraction is viewed as a matrix whose rows
//! and columns are mixed-radix multi-indices over a *class* of index labels
//! (see `tensorcontract::plan`). The row scatter vector `rscat[i]` gives the element
//! offset of matrix row `i` relative to the tensor base; likewise `cscat[j]`
//! for columns. Element `(i, j)` then lives at `base + rscat[i] + cscat[j]`.
//!
//! The *block* scatter vector records, for each aligned block of `blk`
//! consecutive scatter entries, whether those entries form an arithmetic
//! progression, and with what stride. When they do, the corresponding slice of
//! the matrix can be traversed with ordinary strided (often unit-stride)
//! accesses — the "regular" fast path. When they do not, the generic gather
//! path is used. This is the block-scatter-matrix layout of Matthews
//! (arXiv:1607.00291).
//!
//! Note that a *zero* block stride is meaningful and legal here: it arises for
//! contraction indices that are absent from one operand (TAPP "isolated"
//! indices, i.e. reductions), where the same element is read repeatedly.
//! Irregular blocks are therefore flagged with a dedicated sentinel rather
//! than with zero as in some other implementations.
//!
//! Everything public here is a pure function of `i64` slices with no coupling
//! to the rest of the engine, which is why it is API rather than an internal
//! detail: it is the only way for a caller — the project's own benchmark
//! harness included — to describe the traversal the engine is about to make,
//! and to report regularity at the same granularity the engine sees. Combine
//! with `tensorcontract::Plan::oriented_scatters` and
//! `tensorcontract::kernel::plan_config`, which give the vectors and the block sizes
//! actually used.
//!
//! # Forcing the gather path
//!
//! Both packing and the output write-back take the regular path when the block
//! scatter permits it. `Tuning::writeback_gather` makes the write-back use the
//! general scatter loop unconditionally, disabling the block-scatter row
//! addressing and the `alpha = 1, beta = 0` copy along with it. Results are
//! unaffected — this exists so the fast path is an A/B switch rather than a
//! rebuild, in the same spirit as a pinned scalar kernel (`KernelForce::Scalar`).
