//! Owning workspace: page-aligned, grow-only, reused per worker.
//!
//! A workspace belongs to exactly one owner — a `tprims_exec::Pool` or a caller
//! that wants reuse — and is *lent* to the driver for one call at a time. There
//! is deliberately no process-global arena: storage handed to a team is
//! returned to the provider that issued it, and a second owner can never see
//! it.
//!
//! Two payload shapes:
//!
//! * **worker buffers** — the packed A block, the accumulator tile and the
//!   scratch vector of one thread. They are allocated by the thread that will
//!   write them, which is what makes their first touch local to the node that
//!   keeps using them; a thread-local handle names its slot in the owner, and a
//!   handle outlives nothing: the storage is the owner's, the handle is only an
//!   index, and a slot that has been trimmed is simply re-created.
//! * **team sets** — the shared packed B panel, the team's scatter vectors and
//!   its barriers. They are taken exclusively for the duration of a call and
//!   returned on drop, so two concurrent executes can never share one.
//!
//! # Exclusivity
//!
//! A slot that is *in the owner's map* is touched only while the map lock is
//! held. A slot that is *checked out* is not in the map at all: the thread that
//! checked it out is its only owner until it is returned, so a re-entrant call
//! on that thread finds nothing and allocates fresh call-local buffers instead
//! of aliasing the ones its outer call is using (waiting for itself would
//! deadlock). `trim` and the accounting snapshot therefore never observe a slot
//! another thread is writing.
//!
//! `ArenaProvider::traced()` additionally records every growth's thread and
//! size, which is how the tests prove that a worker's buffers were allocated by
//! the worker. Tracing is off by default and only covers buffers the owner
//! keeps; the fresh re-entrant path is not traced.
