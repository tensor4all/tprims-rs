//! The whole-backend trait: an extension seam for a second implementation of a
//! contraction.
//!
//! Object safe for each fixed `T`: a runtime slot holds
//! `Box<dyn ContractionBackend<T>>` and dispatches the dtype in the consumer.
//! The trait lives inside this crate by maintainer decision; it is an
//! extension seam here, not a claim of dependency-isolated implementation
//! choice.
