//! The five-loop driver.
//!
//! tprims: threads come only from a [`tprims_exec::Exec`] (not upstream); this
//! crate spawns none, and without an `Exec` the driver runs serially.
//!
//! Structurally identical to BLIS's GEMM: two levels of cache blocking with a
//! packing step at each, wrapped around a register-blocked micro-kernel. The
//! only tensor-specific part is that every matrix access goes through a
//! scatter vector.
//!
//! ```text
//! for each Hadamard (batch) index h          -- offsets all four operands
//!   loop 5: for jc in 0..N step NC
//!     loop 4: for pc in 0..K step KC
//!               pack B[pc:pc+KC, jc:jc+NC] -> Bp    (NR slivers)
//!       loop 3: for ic in 0..M step MC
//!                 pack A[ic:ic+MC, pc:pc+KC] -> Ap  (MR slivers)
//!         loop 2: for jr in 0..NC step NR
//!           loop 1: for ir in 0..MC step MR
//!                     micro-kernel -> MR x NR tile
//!                     write back to C/D through the scatter vectors
//! ```
//!
//! The loop nest is identical for real and for all three complex methods. What
//! the complex method changes is captured entirely by the selected
//! [`Ukr`](crate::kernel::Ukr): its `a_pack`/`b_pack` formats, its per-k sliver
//! widths, its tile size and its `tile_fmt`. Nothing here branches on the
//! method, which is what makes the three genuinely comparable — they share
//! every line of index analysis, packing traversal, loop arithmetic and
//! write-back scatter.
//!
//! `beta` and the `C` operand are consumed on the first `pc` iteration only;
//! later iterations accumulate into `D`.
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! BLIS-style, and two-dimensional: the output is cut into a `pm x pn` grid of
//! contiguous row strips of whole `MR` panels by column groups of whole `NR`
//! blocks, one thread each. [`Plan::partition`] decides `(pm, pn)` and is the
//! single definition of it; `pn > 1` only when `ceil(M / MR) < p`, so on all but
//! four of the 49 corpus cases this is still a 1-D partition of `M` and behaves
//! exactly as the first version did.
//!
//! The two axes are cut in different places, and deliberately:
//!
//! * The **row strips** are cut once, outside everything, and each thread runs
//!   loops 3, 2 and 1 over its own strip with its own packed-`A` block.
//! * The **column groups** are cut *inside* loop 5, per `NC` block: every thread
//!   iterates the same `(h, jc, pc)` sequence over the whole of `N` and `K`, and
//!   within each `jc` block takes its group's contiguous range of `NR` slivers.
//!
//! Cutting `N` inside loop 5 rather than over the whole range is what keeps the
//! packed-`B` panel single and shared. It stays exactly the L3-sized panel the
//! `NC` budget is derived for — a top-level split of `N` would need `pn` panels
//! and `pn` times the L3 — and it keeps loops 5 and 4 identical across all `p`
//! threads, which is what makes the barrier counts agree without anyone tracking
//! them (see `run_strip`).
//!
//! `B` is packed cooperatively: within a column group, the `pm` threads that
//! share it split its slivers, so each thread packs slivers it will itself read
//! and no thread packs anything it will not. Two barriers per `(jc, pc)` bracket
//! the packing — one so nobody is still reading the previous panel, one so the
//! new one is complete — and they are **per column group**, of `pm` threads,
//! because a group's slice of the panel is written and read only by its own
//! threads. A one-thread column group therefore needs no barrier at all, which
//! is the case a pure `N` split (`pm == 1`) degenerates to: no synchronisation
//! anywhere in the loop nest.
//!
//! The packed `A` block is per thread and so is **duplicated `pn` times**: the
//! `pn` threads of one row strip each pack that strip for themselves. That is
//! deliberate rather than merely convenient. It costs `ceil(panels/pm) * MR * K`
//! element moves per thread against `ceil(panels/pm) * ceil(blocks/pn) * MR * NR
//! * K` lane-FMAs, i.e. one packed element per `NR * ceil(blocks/pn)` FMA slots,
//! and it buys back the alternative's cost: a single packer per row strip needs a
//! barrier *inside* loop 3, at `M/MC` times the frequency of the ones above it,
//! and leaves the block in one thread's L2 for the others to pull across L3
//! instead of each having it in its own. `Plan::partition` prices the duplication
//! explicitly and will not split `N` when a thread would be left with too few
//! `NR` blocks to amortise it over.
//!
//! Four properties this buys, all of them deliberate:
//!
//! * **No reduction.** Loop 4 (`pc`) accumulates into `D` in place, so
//!   parallelising it would need either a temporary per thread or atomics.
//!   Partitioning the *output* instead gives every element a single owning
//!   thread, which accumulates over the full `K` in the original order. Both
//!   axes have this property; `K` is the one that does not, and it is left
//!   serial.
//! * **Bitwise identical to serial**, therefore, for any thread count and any
//!   `(pm, pn)` — the floating-point operations per output element are the same
//!   operations in the same order. That is a strong enough invariant to test
//!   directly, and the `threaded_matches_serial_*` tests do.
//! * **Blocks stay aligned with the block scatter.** Strips are whole `MR`
//!   panels and groups whole `NR` slivers, so every thread's micro-tiles are the
//!   ones the serial driver would have used. The write-back fast path, the
//!   row-block rule and the orientation rule are untouched by threading.
//! * **The serial path is unchanged.** With `pm == pn == 1` the only difference
//!   from the pre-threading driver is two `Option` checks and a handful of
//!   integer divisions per `(jc, pc)` iteration, nowhere near the hot loops.
//!   Every measurement committed in `docs/archive/tensorprimitives/notebook/` was taken single-threaded and
//!   stays comparable.
//!
//! # Batch-axis claiming
//!
//! Everything above cuts *one* entry of the in-plan batch (the Hadamard modes)
//! across the team, and the team runs the entries one after another with its
//! barriers per entry. For tiny entries, or at least as many entries as workers,
//! that is the wrong cut: on the default partition the driver instead gives each
//! of a few lanes a contiguous share of the entries, each run serially with the
//! serial blocking and the lane's own buffers, with no barrier and no shared `B`
//! panel. The result is bitwise the serial one. The width rule is the one
//! function `batch::lanes`.
//!
//! Known limits, in the order they will bite (see the Phase 4 report):
//! parallelism is capped at `ceil(M / MR) * ceil(N / NR)`, and a column group can
//! only be as wide as the `jc` block it is cut from, so a tail `NC` block with
//! fewer slivers than groups leaves some threads idle for that block; and `NC`'s
//! L3 budget is still charged as if one core owned the cache.
//!
//! The per-call spawn cost that used to head that list — `std::thread::scope`
//! rather than a pool, ~20–36 µs per thread and the whole story below a megabyte
//! (A43, D46) — is gone: the threads of one call are the workers of the host's
//! [`tprims_exec::Pool`], co-scheduled by [`tprims_exec::Exec::broadcast`]. For
//! many small contractions, [`crate::batch`] parallelises over a *batch*
//! instead of inside each contraction.
