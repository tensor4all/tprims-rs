//! `PartitionPolicy::DynamicTiles`: dynamic assignment of output work
//! (tprims addition, issue #29; spec §6.1 of the switchable-engine design).
//!
//! The team traverses one **epoch** per `(batch, NC panel, KC slab)` in
//! lockstep. Per epoch:
//!
//! 1. worker 0 resets the claim counter, and every worker packs a disjoint range
//!    of `NR` slivers of the shared `B` panel (none for a direct-B call);
//! 2. a **publication** barrier: `B` is complete and read-only, the reset is
//!    visible (`fetch_add(Relaxed)` only makes claims unique; the barrier
//!    publishes);
//! 3. workers claim jobs until none are left — row bands when there are at
//!    least as many bands as workers, `(band, column subtile)` jobs otherwise —
//!    pack their own `A` and run the shared tile arithmetic of
//!    [`compute_block`](super::compute_block);
//! 4. a **completion** barrier taken by every worker, whether or not it claimed
//!    anything, so the next epoch may overwrite `B` and reset the counter.
//!
//! K is never split and no accumulation is atomic: a tile's K slabs run in the
//! original order (a later slab starts only after the previous epoch's
//! completion barrier), so the result is bitwise identical to the static and
//! serial runs for a fixed blocking. A width-1 call never enters this module.
//!
//! Claiming is not work stealing: there are no deques, only one monotonic
//! counter per epoch. Its claims are bounded by `jobs + width` (every worker
//! stops at its first claim past the end), and `Plan` resolution proves that
//! sum fits in `usize` before any broadcast, so the counter cannot wrap.
