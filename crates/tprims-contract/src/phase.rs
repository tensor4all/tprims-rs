//! Optional per-phase timing of the packed driver.
//!
//! Off unless the `phase-timing` feature is on, and every call site is behind
//! `#[cfg(feature = "phase-timing")]`, so a default build pays nothing. It is an
//! instrument in the same spirit as `benchmarks/scripts/idle_cpus.py`: it answers
//! "which phase of the packed route absorbs this case's time", which nothing else
//! in the tree can on this host - `perf` events are blocked
//! (`kernel.perf_event_paranoid` is 4), `/proc/<pid>/stat` masks the user PC, and
//! Yama refuses the ptrace a sampler would need.
//!
//! Read it a call late: the counters are printed and cleared at the *start* of the
//! next `execute_raw`, so one line describes the execution that just finished. The
//! last four numbers are the phases; `setup` is that execution's wall time minus
//! those four, i.e. the loops, the epoch bookkeeping and everything between the
//! phases.
//!
//! # What it does and does not mean
//!
//! * **Measure at one thread.** The counters sum *worker* time, and with N workers
//!   the phases can add up to more than the call's wall time, so the percentages
//!   stop being wall-clock shares (and `setup` saturates at zero). At one thread
//!   they are shares of the call, which is the reading the campaign's design work
//!   needed.
//! * **One execution at a time.** The counters are process-global and the snapshot
//!   is taken at the next entry, so two overlapping calls mix or drop each other's
//!   numbers. Report from a serialized session.
//! * **`writeback` covers `emit_tile` only.** A Direct family writes `D` inside the
//!   tile call, so that store is charged to `kernel` and `writeback` stays 0 - which
//!   is why the instrument's first documented example reads 0 for a Direct case.
//! * **`pack_b`** is timed at both call sites (static and dynamic) but not on the
//!   direct-B path, where nothing is packed.
//! * **`block_meta` and `permute`** exist for the blocked outer traversal: its emit
//!   loop is the write-back and is charged to `writeback`, its per-block gathers,
//!   scatters and row order to `block_meta`, and the grid permutation with the
//!   output-ordered rows and scatters to `permute`. Without them the whole traversal
//!   lands in `setup`, which is where it used to hide.
