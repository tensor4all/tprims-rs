/// Per-dtype upper bound on the GEMM volume `m * n * k` (per batch item) of a
/// fused problem that the planner sends to faer (rule 3 of
/// [`Plan`](super::Plan)). Above it the packed driver runs instead. `None`
/// means no bound.
///
/// The default bounds only `c64`, at `2^17`: on the #61 corpus (Apple M5 Max,
/// 1 thread) faer wins the MPS steps up to chi = 16 (`2 chi^3 = 8192`), ties
/// at chi = 32 (`65536`) and loses by 1.17x at chi = 64 (`524288`). The value
/// is provisional until the crossover sweep of
/// [#63](https://github.com/tensor4all/tprims-rs/issues/63) fixes the
/// predicate and the per-dtype values; the other dtypes are unbounded until
/// measured. The 2026-10-09 sweep of
/// [#69](https://github.com/tensor4all/tprims-rs/issues/69) measures both C modes,
/// and with a [`NONE`](Self::NONE) arm both sides of the c64 bound: on the host it
/// ran on, faer is ahead of the packed driver at every fusable volume it measured
/// at one thread — including above the bound, by 1.05x to 1.58x — while at four
/// threads the packed driver is ahead there for 18 of 79 groups. The crossover is
/// therefore host- and width-dependent, no single per-dtype volume is justified by
/// that evidence, and these values stay provisional. See
/// `docs/decision-log.md`.
