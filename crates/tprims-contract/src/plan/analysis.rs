//! Index analysis: a validated [`Problem`] seen as a (batched) matrix product
//! over scatter vectors.
//!
//! Given the normalized roles of a [`Problem`], this module works out how to
//! view the contraction
//!
//! ```text
//! D[idx_D] = alpha * op_A(A[idx_A]) * op_B(B[idx_B]) + beta * op_C(C[idx_C])
//! ```
//!
//! as a (batched) matrix multiplication over scatter matrices.
//!
//! # Index classes
//!
//! Every distinct label is assigned to exactly one class:
//!
//! | class | in A | in B | in D | role |
//! |-------|------|------|------|------|
//! | `M`   | yes  | no   | yes  | free index of A, rows of the GEMM |
//! | `N`   | no   | yes  | yes  | free index of B, columns of the GEMM |
//! | `K`   | yes  | yes  | no   | contracted index |
//! | `H`   | yes  | yes  | yes  | Hadamard / batch index |
//!
//! Two further cases fold into `K` rather than needing special machinery:
//!
//! * a label present **only in A** (TAPP "isolated" index, i.e. a reduction
//!   `sum_i A[...,i,...]`) becomes a contraction index with `stride_B = 0`;
//! * likewise a label present only in B becomes one with `stride_A = 0`.
//!
//! Because the block-scatter machinery treats a zero stride as a perfectly
//! regular access pattern, this costs nothing and — unlike a pre-reduction
//! pass — needs no workspace. A label present only in the output (TAPP
//! "case 5", broadcasting) is rejected; TAPP does not require it.
//!
//! # Repeated labels
//!
//! A label repeated within a single tensor selects that tensor's diagonal.
//! Extents must agree and the strides are summed, after which the label is
//! treated as a single mode. This is applied per tensor before classification.
//!
//! # Ordering and folding
//!
//! Within a class the labels are ordered fastest-varying first, then adjacent
//! labels are merged whenever their extents and strides are compatible in
//! *every* operand (`s_next == s_prev * extent_prev`). Folding is what makes
//! an ordinary matrix multiply collapse to a single index per class — and
//! therefore to a plain GEMM with fully regular block scatter — and it
//! substantially raises the regular-block fraction for real contractions.
//!
//! The ordering heuristic is: class `M`, `N` and `H` are ordered by increasing
//! |stride| in `D`, class `K` by increasing |stride| in `A`. Rationale: the
//! output update is the one access that packing cannot hide, so `D` gets first
//! claim on contiguity; `K` only affects the packing of `A` and `B`. This is a
//! heuristic and a Phase 4 tuning knob.
