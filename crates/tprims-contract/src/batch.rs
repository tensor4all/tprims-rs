//! Many independent contractions, with the **batch** as the parallel axis.
//!
//! Parallelising over a batch of `n` contractions needs no barrier: items are
//! wholly independent, so the work is plain fork-join over the host's
//! [`Exec`], and this crate spawns no thread of its own.
//!
//! # Scheduling
//!
//! | Situation | Route |
//! |---|---|
//! | width 1 | the caller's thread, item after item |
//! | `items >= width` | the items are partitioned over the width, each item serial |
//! | fewer items than the width | items one after another, each on the whole `Exec` (its own inner parallelism) |
//!
//! so the batch axis and the inner axis never nest, and no threads idle while a
//! large item could use them.
//!
//! # What this does not do
//!
//! * **The split is static and contiguous**, by item count. Balancing it by
//!   estimated work is the obvious refinement and is deliberately not guessed at:
//!   D47 measured that block-scatter load imbalance does not cost on the dense
//!   path, and the case where it plausibly does -- **block-sparse, where items
//!   differ in size rather than in regularity** -- is not built either. That is
//!   where a dynamic claim over the batch belongs, and it is what TBLIS uses a
//!   dynamic atomic-claim scheduler for while keeping static partitioning for
//!   dense (part 15). Same division, reached independently.

/// `StridedViewMut` over its own exclusive borrow, so the borrow checker has
/// already proved the outputs disjoint. The plans are shared references and may
/// all be the *same* plan, which is the common case -- a batch of identically
/// shaped contractions. Heterogeneous shapes use one plan per shape.

///
/// # Ordering and results
///
/// Items are independent, so the batch imposes no order between them and the
/// result of each is **bitwise identical to running it alone at the width it
/// ran at** -- an item that runs on one thread takes exactly the serial path of
/// [`Plan::execute_into_accum`]. The batch axis adds no reduction and no
/// accumulation, so there is nothing for a width to change.
///
/// # All or nothing
///
/// Every item's views are checked against its plan **before any item runs**, so
/// a batch containing one bad item writes to no output at all. That is a
/// stronger guarantee than looping over [`Plan::execute_into_accum`] gives, and
/// it is the reason to prefer this even when serial: a partially executed batch
/// leaves the caller unable to say which outputs are valid.
///
/// The guarantee covers that layout preflight only. An item can still fail
/// while executing, after earlier items have written -- for example when the
/// batch loop was entered from inside a pool worker and an item's plan needs a
/// barrier-bearing team ([`Error::Exec`](crate::api::Error::Exec)). There is no
/// whole-batch rollback.
