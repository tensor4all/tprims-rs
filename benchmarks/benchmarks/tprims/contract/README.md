# contract

`tprims-contract` at an enforced thread count on a predeclared corpus, under
the planner's own choice (`plan`) and with the packed driver forced
(`packed`; `--partition dynamic:JM,JN` adds a `packed_dyn..` row). Planning
(`Plan::new`) and execution (`execute_into`, alpha = 1, beta = 0) are timed
separately.

| Case | A (storage order) | B (storage order) | Contraction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny_matmul` | 2 x 2 | 2 x 2 | `ij,jk->ik` |
| `matmul_256` | 256 x 256 | 256 x 256 | `ij,jk->ik` |
| `batched_64_b32` | 64 x 64 x 32 | 64 x 64 x 32 | `ijb,jkb->ikb` |
| `permuted_fusable` | 64 x 32 x 32, stored (c, b, a) | 32 x 32 x 64, stored (d, b, c) | `abc,cbd->ad` |
| `permuted_nonfusable` | 64 x 32 x 32, stored (b, a, c) | 32 x 32 x 64, stored (b, a, d) | `abc,cbd->ad` (A must be copied) |

```bash
cargo build --release -p tprims-bench --bin contract
cpus=$(python3 benchmarks/scripts/idle_cpus.py pick 8)            # one idle L3 domain
benchmarks/benchmarks/tprims/contract/run.sh /tmp/contract "$cpus" 1 4 8
CORPUS=path/to/corpus.json benchmarks/benchmarks/tprims/contract/run.sh /tmp/c2 "$cpus" 1 4 8
```

`run.sh` (`benchmarks/scripts/paired.sh`) runs every case in its own process,
all thread counts of a case back to back, each through `pinned.sh`, and keeps
the `# selected` (algorithm and family) and `CHECK` (plan vs packed) lines in a
log and the commit, CPU, core set and corpus hash in `manifest.txt`.
`contract --corpus FILE` replays the `dot_general` entries of a corpus
(`tprims_bench::corpus`; example: `../corpus/example.json`) in any of
f32/f64/c32/c64 with the recorded strides. The observation below predates
corpus mode and used the older `run.sh CPUS1 CPUS4 OUT` (1T/4T only).

`BENCH_C_MODE=separate_b0|separate_b1|separate_same` replays the same corpus
with a separately described C (the TAPP form, through `execute_raw`): beta 0,
beta 0.5 with C in its own buffer, beta 0.5 with C being D.

### 2026-10-03 Phase 2 W2: separate C on faer

`tenferro-p1-gemm` (53 GEMM-fusable shapes), packed/faer calls-weighted
workload (above 1 = faer faster), unconditional faer routing, CPUs 24-31 of one
CCD, `BENCH_RUNS=5`, one session ([`results/2026-10-03-phase2-w2/`](results/2026-10-03-phase2-w2/),
[`decision.txt`](results/2026-10-03-phase2-w2/decision.txt)):

| Mode | 1T | 4T | 8T |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `separate_b0` (beta 0, C unread) | 1.078 | 1.173 | 1.249 |
| `separate_b1` (beta 0.5, distinct C) | 1.024 | 1.002 | 1.027 |
| `separate_same` (beta 0.5, C is D; serial in-place scale) | 1.048 | 1.028 | 0.967 |

With beta nonzero the `D := beta * op_C(C)` pass costs 20-50% of faer's time on
large outputs with small K, where faer then loses to packed at 4T/8T. The
planner therefore sends a separate C to faer only for K >= 512 or at most 2^20
output elements (workload under the rule 1.06-1.19 at 4T/8T; `decision.txt`).
Three cases that were overwrite wins flipped to losses under that first rule at 8T
(`gemm_batched_041/043/044`, outputs of 220-330K elements, K 7-11; 0.78-0.89);
W2b ([`results/2026-10-03-phase2-w2b/`](results/2026-10-03-phase2-w2b/decision.txt))
replaced it by a stricter rule, `separate_c_pays`. W2b also sent `beta == 0` to
faer through a second, lazily dispatched fusion; the clean confirmation
([`results/2026-10-04-phase2-w2b-clean/`](results/2026-10-04-phase2-w2b-clean/decision.txt))
showed that route losing to packed at 4T/8T on the very cases the stricter rule
declines, at `beta == 0` too where there is no pass, and it was removed: the
packed driver now serves a declined separate C at every beta.
No A/A run (host shared); packed rows of two sessions agree within 2%.

### 2026-10-01 switchable GEMM engine: non-regression

Branch (`gemm-engine-spec`, kernel-family contract and engine selection) against
`main` at `690794c`, on `../corpus/tenferro-p1.json`, `BENCH_RUNS=5`, each
session pinned and verified idle. Metric: calls-weighted workload time
(`calls x exec median` summed over the corpus) per group; noise: mean
`|log(total / median over sessions)|` of each side. A group passes when its
ratio is within `max(5%, the larger side's noise)`.

| T | `pg_exec` (new/old) | noise | `tblis_exec` (new/old) | noise | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0.988 | 0.018 | 0.933 | 0.009 | pass |
| 4 | 1.002 | 0 | 0.966 | 0 | pass |
| 8 | 1.023 | 0.022 | 0.950 | 0.002 | pass |

The driver whose hand-off changed (`tblis_exec`) is 3-7% faster at every thread
count, and the permute + GEMM row is within the measured noise. Raw sessions and
the full `decision.txt`, including the five-session subset blocks that give 4T
and 8T a non-zero noise band, are under
[`results/2026-10-01-gemm-engine/`](results/2026-10-01-gemm-engine/).


## Observation, 2026-09-30 (single run, not a claim)

- tprims-rs `0e68641` (clean tree), release profile (thin LTO,
  codegen-units 1), rustc 1.97.1, faer 0.24.4.
- AMD EPYC 7713P, shared host (load average about 4); cores 57-60 (one L3
  domain) busy fraction <= 0.01 over 3 s before and after. Sub-microsecond
  rows are within the ~20% A/A noise floor measured earlier for the removed linalg rows.
- Raw output: [results/](results/) (CSVs, and `*.selected.log` with the `# selected` and `CHECK` lines). All `CHECK` lines ok (relative
  difference <= 1.5e-15); every case ran copy-free under `pg` except
  `permuted_nonfusable`, where A was materialized.

### Findings

1. **Permute plus batched GEMM wins wherever the operands fuse**: TBLIS-style
   is 1.1-2.0x slower at 1T and 1.1-1.9x at 4T (4.1x for `batched_64_b32` at
   4T, where the pg path spreads the batch over the pool and the packed driver's
   batch axis is serial inside each SPMD team).
2. **When an operand must be copied, TBLIS-style is competitive and wins at
   4T** (`permuted_nonfusable`: tblis/pg 0.92 f64, 0.88 c64 at 4T), because
   the pg path pays for a copy of A that the direct kernel avoids
   (hypothesis: the copy, although parallel above strided's threshold, is
   bandwidth-bound; pg itself only scales 1.4x there). This is the first case where the direct strategy is preferable;
   an `Auto` rule "TBLIS when pg would materialize a large operand" is a
   candidate, to be decided on a wider corpus (decided in P2 below).
3. Planning costs 1-2 us for pg and 1.6-14 us for tblis (scatter vectors of
   length M + N + K); both are outside `execute`.

## Phase 1e P2: tenferro shape corpus (2026-09-30)

- Corpus: [`../corpus/tenferro-p1.json`](../corpus/tenferro-p1.json), 57
  `dot_general` shape groups (3150 calls) logged from tenferro-benchmark's
  einsum suite (25 instances) and `cpu/public_api` quick run through the
  tprims provider (`TPRIMS_SHAPE_LOG`, 1T), weighted by call count.
- Runs: tprims-rs `d8e565a`, release profile, AMD EPYC 7713P, CPUs 0-7 (one
  CCD, idle-checked before and after every run by `pinned.sh`), 1T/4T/8T
  paired per case, `BENCH_RUNS=7`, three complete sessions
  ([`results/2026-09-30-p2/`](results/2026-09-30-p2/), manifests inside). A
  first session 3 stopped after 11 cases (idle retries exhausted) and was
  discarded and rerun in full.
- Decision ([`decision.txt`](results/2026-09-30-p2/decision.txt)): workload
  time pg / tblis = 1.42-1.47 (1T), 1.57-1.66 (4T), 1.70-1.87 (8T), noise
  1.7-4.7%; unweighted geometric mean 0.93-1.09. All `CHECK` lines ok.

Workload time by what permute+GEMM must copy (session 3):

| pg copies | cases | 1T pg | 1T tblis | ratio | 8T pg | 8T tblis | ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A and B | 23 | 12.32 s | 8.05 s | 1.53 | 3.48 s | 1.59 s | 2.19 |
| B | 9 | 3.33 s | 2.39 s | 1.39 | 0.77 s | 0.44 s | 1.76 |
| A | 6 | 1.17 s | 0.66 s | 1.78 | 0.36 s | 0.16 s | 2.21 |
| nothing | 19 | 0.83 s | 0.88 s | 0.94 | 0.16 s | 0.41 s | 0.40 |

Findings:

1. The tensor-network contractions of tensor4all are high rank with small
   extents, and their contracted axes are rarely adjacent in storage, so
   permute+GEMM copies at least one operand in 38 of 57 groups, which carry
   over 95% of the workload time. TBLIS-style packs straight from the
   strides and skips that copy; the gap widens with threads (hypothesis: the
   copy is bandwidth-bound and scales worse than the arithmetic).
2. Without a copy the comparison is GEMM kernel against GEMM kernel, and
   faer wins (also seen in the batched-GEMM corpus); the difference is
   presumably already in the GEMM kernel, blocking or threading, to be
   checked separately.
3. Hence `Strategy::Auto` now picks TBLIS-style exactly when permute+GEMM
   would copy (decision log), which is also the best of both columns above.

## Hadamard products: elementwise path vs TBLIS-style (2026-09-30)

Whether the dedicated all-batch path could be dropped in favour of the
TBLIS-style kernel. Corpus [`../corpus/hadamard.json`](../corpus/hadamard.json):
24 cases, f64 and c64, vectors of 2^10-2^24 elements, 256^2 and 2048^2
matrices, rank-4 and rank-12 tensors, some with B stored transposed (`_bT`).
The `pg` rows run tprims-contract's elementwise path (`PermuteGemm` and
`Auto` both route all-batch problems there), `tblis` rows the TBLIS-style
kernel. Same setup as P2: tprims-rs `d8e565a`, EPYC 7713P CPUs 0-7, 1T/4T/8T
paired per case, three sessions
([`results/2026-09-30-hadamard/`](results/2026-09-30-hadamard/)). All `CHECK`
lines ok.

TBLIS-style time / elementwise time, median over sessions:

| threads | range over the 24 cases | f64, 2^22 vector | c64, 2^22 vector | f64, 256^2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1T | 7.0-24.4x | 24.4x | 11.2x | 21.5x |
| 4T | 11.2-92.1x | 92.1x | 46.0x | 21.7x |
| 8T | 10.1-131.6x | 131.6x | 61.7x | 18.0x |

The TBLIS-style kernel runs a Hadamard product as a batch of 1x1x1 GEMMs,
paying micro-kernel and packing overhead per element, and its batch axis is
serial inside the SPMD team, so it does not scale with threads while the
elementwise path does (hypothesis consistent with the growth from 1T to 8T).
The dedicated elementwise path stays.

## Phase 2 S3: batch-axis claiming (2026-10-03)

The in-plan batch axis runs barrier-free across the pool when the entries are
tiny or at least as many as the workers (`driver/batch.rs`). Before/after
(c71bba4 vs the S3 branch, packed row, 1T/4T/8T, two sessions): tiny batched
entries 3-50x faster at 4T/8T (`dot_general_049` 11.3 ms -> 0.29 ms at 8T), large
single GEMMs unchanged within noise. Details and the decision:
[`results/2026-10-03-phase2-s3-batch/`](results/2026-10-03-phase2-s3-batch/).

## Phase 2 W3: pack and write-back codegen, blocking arms (2026-10-03)

Pack and write-back carry their conjugation / beta / alpha flags as const
generics (resolved once per panel call or tile) and have `avx2,fma` variants
bound with the kernel family. Packed route, two sessions: complex 1T about -5%
(`gemm_1024_c64`, `dot_general_031_c64`, `gemm_batched_009_c64`), f64 neutral,
4T/8T no regression beyond the control row; `cargo test --release -p
tprims-contract --no-run` 61 s -> 69 s. Blocking arms (kc=512 with a 256 KiB A
budget; the analytical model) do not beat the legacy blocking, so it stays
([`results/2026-10-03-phase2-w3a/`](results/2026-10-03-phase2-w3a/),
[`results/2026-10-03-phase2-w3b/`](results/2026-10-03-phase2-w3b/)).
